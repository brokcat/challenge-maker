# Challenge Maker Repository

Welcome to my Challenge Maker repository! Here, you'll find original cybersecurity challenges designed for platforms like CyberDefenders and beyond. My goal is to share engaging, realistic scenarios to help the community grow and learn.

## About Me

I'm a passionate Challenge Maker on CyberDefenders and likely on other platforms as well. My interests include:
- Endpoint Forensics

- Many other domains in the cyber defensive world and space

I'm currently a student at **Ecole 2600**, a cybersecurity school in Paris. :fr: :pirate_flag:
