# Challenge Maker

I am a Challenge Maker on CyberDefenders and likely on other platforms as well.

I am passionate about endpoint forensics, network forensics, threat hunting, CTI (Cyber Threat Intelligence), and many other fields in the cyber defensive world and space.

If you wish to contact me, you can reach me on Discord at **brokcat**. Feel free to send me feedback about my challengesâ€”I'd love to hear your thoughts!

I am a student at **Ecole 2600**, a cybersecurity school in Paris. :fr: :pirate_flag:
